# RockstarProjects
Just a dump of random Rockstar code I have written.

## What is Rockstar?
Rockstar is an esoteric programming language. Check it out [here](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar)

## How do I run this?
~~I personally use the [Python transpilier](https://github.com/yanorestes/rockstar-py), but on the main Rockstar page there are various compilers and interpreters.~~

While I used to use the python transpiler, due in part to it not fully conforming to the spec I have since switched to the [Ruby transpiler (Kaiser)](https://github.com/marcinruszkiewicz/kaiser-ruby). **Everything in this repo has only been tested with Kaiser**. As far as I know, no compiler for Rockstar perfectly fits the spec (all have some issues, or resolve ambiguities in different ways), but all code in this repo should compile specifically in Kaiser.
