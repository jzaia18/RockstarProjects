# RockstarProjects
Just a dump of random Rockstar code I have written.

## What is Rockstar?
Rockstar is an esoteric programming language. Check it out [here](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar)

## How do I run this?
I personally use the [Python transpilier](https://github.com/yanorestes/rockstar-py), but on the main Rockstar page there are various compilers and interpreters.
